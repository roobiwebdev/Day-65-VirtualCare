🔥#Day65 of #100DaysChallenge

Hey guys

for day 65 I've made a cool landing page with smooth animations and a mobile-friendly design 

☑️ I added a nice animation when users scroll up and down

☑️ a counting number animation in the "Our Status" section 

☑️ a cool hover effect with shadows on the cards plus users can also swipe left and right by grabbing the cards or by clicking the pagination bullets. 

It's been an exciting project and the final result looks fantastic check it out and let me know what you think⚡️👍
